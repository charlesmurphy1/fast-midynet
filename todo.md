# To-do list before "first release" of the code
1. PyBinding the code. [Done]
2. DegreeCountPrior and DegreeHyperPrior.
3. BlockPrior that stands for degree labels for correlated Configuration model [Done, impracticle]
4. Implementing CorrelatedConfigurationModelFamily (sub-class of SBM) [Done, impracticle]
5. Finish implementating MetricsConfig and MetricFactory. [Done]
6. Finish implementating all relevant metrics.
7. Implementating ProposerFactory.
8. Testing Experiment and ExperimentConfig.
9. Finish implementating of ScriptManager and testing.
10. Enumeration of graphs in C++ class

# Potential to-do list
1. Hierarchical version of the stochastic block model (needs re-implementation of all SBM priors)
2. SBM-based edge proposers that dependents on the block structure.
