# To-do list before "first release" of the code
1. PyBinding the code. [Done]
2. DegreeCountPrior and DegreeHyperPrior.
3. BlockPrior that stands for degree labels for correlated Configuration model [Done, impracticle]
4. Implementing CorrelatedConfigurationModelFamily (sub-class of SBM) [Done, impracticle]
5. After PyBinging: implementation of estimators in python. [In progress]
6. Finish implementating MetricsConfig and MetricFactory.
7. Finish implementating all relevant metrics.
8. Implementating ProposerFactory.
9. Testing Experiment and ExperimentConfig.
10. Finish implementating of ScriptManager and testing.
11. Enumeration of graphs in C++ class

# Potential to-do list
1. Hierarchical version of the stochastic block model (needs re-implementation of all SBM priors)
2. SBM-based edge proposers that dependents on the block structure.
