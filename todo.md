# To-do list before "first release" of the code
1. PyBinding the code.
2. DegreeCountPrior and DegreeHyperPrior.
3. BlockPrior that stands for degree labels for correlated Configuration model
4. Implementing CorrelatedConfigurationModelFamily (sub-class of SBM)
5. After PyBinging: implementation of estimators in python.

# Potential to-do list
1. Hierarchical version of the stochastic block model (needs re-implementation of all SBM priors)
2. SBM-based edge proposers that dependents on the block structure.
